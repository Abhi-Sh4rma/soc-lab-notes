# Day 01 – Getting Oriented

Today’s goal:
- Set up my GitHub learning log
- Understand how I’ll use this repo for SOC learning

What I understand about SOC:
- SOC analysts monitor systems and logs
- Logs record events like logins, failures, and errors
- Learning to read logs is a core skill

What I plan to do next:
- Learn Windows Event Logs
- Start with failed login events
- Document everything I learn here
